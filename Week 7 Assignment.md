Cryptoteros is a web app for cryptocurrency holders that allows users to set notifications based on conditions or indicators of their choice amd their crypto holdings. This webapp specifically will interface with coinbase.com. This API allows users to read data from their portfolio without sharing their log in information. There are several indicators which a user will be able to choose from. This webapp will provide value by providing a feature that coinbase currently does not have. This feature will allow users to buy and sell crypto faster based on their preferred investing strategy.
